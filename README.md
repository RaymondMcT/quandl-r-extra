# quandl-r-extra
Supplementary functions for the quandl-r package

## Purpose

I have come to use some helper functions while using the Quandl R-package. They are not quite polished to be used in the main package and also may not be as simplistic as the core Quandl functions. I have decided to release them here rather than just keep them to myself in the hopes they might be useful.

Needless to say they are provided here without warranty.
